Final project - Secured APIs in hybrid cloud 

The idea behind the project is combining the things I learned during my cyber specialization in my Bsc studies with the cloud world I discovered during my first year at Red Hat. 
The subject of the research is “Secured APIs in hybrid cloud”

What is a hybrid cloud? An IT architecture that incorporates some degree of workload portability, orchestration, and management across two or more environments,  At least one private cloud and at least one public cloud

What is an API? API stands for application programming interface - set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. 

Why does it need to be secured? When working with two or more separate clouds holding a data set that needs to be orchestrated between them, the pipelines where the data is passed through must be secured to prevent data loss or theft. These cloud APIs define in what form the data will be passed in this pipeline - then this form is built right and secured - the data is safe. 

Project goals:
- study cloud architectures in particular hybrid cloud
- isolate security issues and flaws in these architectures
- identify the important components of a secured API 
- design a new API security plugin for RedHat’’s OpenShift platform.

The project will be led by Dr. Amit Dvir from Ariel University & Luiza Nacshon from Red Hat.
